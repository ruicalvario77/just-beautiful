**Homepage:** The main landing page that welcomes visitors, showcases featured products, best sellers and new products, and includes a newsletter signup. It should also have a beautifully designed layout that makes it very appealing to customers. I would like a category scroller as well. I would also like to have a section that can be switched on and off that will display themes so for example, next is Fathers day, I want a section that is built up for Fathers Day with a nice creative and maybe some featured products in a bento box.

**Category Page (PLP Page):** This will show once a customer selects a specific category and will include a filter with options to filter by colour, price, theme. Each item will show in a grid and will have the product image, description, price, special price if on special, colour variations picker and will also have a section that mentions customize your product.

**Product Pages:** Individual pages for each product, showing detailed information, images, and customization options (if applicable) like colour and size. It will also have related Products or upsells and crossells 

**Customization Popup:** There will also be a button to customize the design on the product pages (if applicable) which will open a full screen popup and this is where we will develop our product customizer which will allow a customer to add an image which will show a live view and if available they can add text. We will somethimes have the option of adding back and front designs/text or even on the side of the shirts. I want the customizer to make sure we can have it moduler, shirts will have different options to mugs etc. It should also allow to select a font from all Google Fonts.

**Cart:** A page where customers review selected items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.

**Checkout:** The final step where customers enter payment and shipping details to complete their purchase.

**Contact:** A page with a contact form and business information for customer inquiries or support.
